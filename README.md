Hello,

You're probably here because you've heard of [Frontier](https://frontierwallet.com) and are interested in what we're building. 

Most of our development (for now) happens in a closed kitchen by incredible developers and designers who love their crafts.

Our work and private repositories don't appear on GitHub organization pages, which can make things look pretty abandoned. Rest assured that a lot of cool things are coming, which you can keep track of by following:

- [Frontier Telegram Group](https://t.me/frontierwallet)
- [Frontier Telegram Announcements](https://t.me/frontierwallet_ann)
- [Frontier on Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontierwallet)
- [Frontier on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialFrontierWallet/)
- [Frontier on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontierwallet/)

Thanks so much for visiting us and being curious. If you'd like access to beta versions of Frontier or are a developer who is keen to dig into the things we're making, feel free to email us. 

- Android testers can reach us at android [at] frontierwallet.com.
- iOS testers can reach us at ios [at] frontierwallet.com. 

Who knows? There might be a special gift waiting for you if you reach out to us and help test what we build. ðŸ™ƒ
